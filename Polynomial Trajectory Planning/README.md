Report for Polynomial Trajectory Planning for a Robot

Trajectory Planning Overview :
The trajectory planning problem consists in finding a relationship between two elements belonging to different domains: time and space.
Accordingly, the trajectory is usually expressed as a parametric function of the time which provides at each instant the corresponding desired position.
Refer to the report for further details and results.
Report also discusses other possible ways for Trajectory Planning like Cell Decomposition Method, Artificial Potential Method etc.
